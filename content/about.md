Hello there! My name is Sneha Kannan. I am a highly motivated, result oriented data scientist with almost 5 years of experience applying statistical learning to solving challenging business problems. I am looking for a new opportunity to utilize my skills and broaden my experience, a position where I feel like I am accomplishing something and am contributing to the growth of the organization. [Here](https://github.com/snehakannan/cv/blob/master/skannan_resume.pdf) is my resume.

I'd like to use this blog as an opportunity to practice skills relevant to data science including data cleaning, visualization, coding, model building and statistics. The most important knowledge I've gained about this field is that it's important to constantly learn and improve on what I know already. What better way to do that than blogging!
