<p>One of my professional goals this year is to use blogging as a medium to practice skills related to data science. As a first step, I have made my resume using <a href="https://pagedown.rbind.io/">pagedown</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://nickstrayer.me/">Nick Strayer</a> and his <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2019/09/04/building_a_data_driven_cv_with_r/">blogpost</a>, I could create my <a href="https://github.com/snehakannan/cv/blob/master/skannan_resume.pdf">resume</a> in RStudio. The blog post was detailed and simplified the process for me. I added the Skills section in the Sidebar and used the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> icons. Once I had the various sections of my resume compiled in the spreadsheet as explained in the blogpost, I tweaked the CSS files for some formatting changes and had the resume saved as a PDF.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/snehakannan/cv">github repository</a> containing the code that was used to generate my resume.</p>
