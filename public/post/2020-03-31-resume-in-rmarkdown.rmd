One of my professional goals this year is to use blogging as a medium to practice skills related to data science. As a first step, I have made my resume using [pagedown](https://pagedown.rbind.io/). Thanks to [Nick Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me/) and his [blogpost](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2019/09/04/building_a_data_driven_cv_with_r/), I could create my [resume](https://github.com/snehakannan/cv/blob/master/skannan_resume.pdf) in RStudio. The blog post was detailed and simplified the process for me. I added the Skills section in the Sidebar and used the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons. Once I had the various sections of my resume compiled in the spreadsheet as explained in the blogpost, I tweaked the CSS files for some formatting changes and had the resume saved as a PDF. 

Here is the [github repository](https://github.com/snehakannan/cv) containing the code that was used to generate my resume.
